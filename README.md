Reverse Linked List - LeetCode Problem 206
- LeetCode Problem 206 gives the programmer a reference to the head of a singly linked list and
asks the programmer to reverse the linked list. The way I implemented this was reversing the linked list in place
since that will allow me to be on O(n) time complexity and on O(1) space complexity proving to be more space efficient
over the recursive way of doing it.

Skills Used:
- Used my knowledge of time complexity and space complexity to arrive to the most efficient answer
- Was able to work with references in Java and practice with the Linked List Data Structure
